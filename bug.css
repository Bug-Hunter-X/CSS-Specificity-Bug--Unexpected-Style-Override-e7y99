The following CSS code snippet suffers from a common error. The specificity of the selector in the second rule is higher than that of the first rule, resulting in the unexpected style applied to the <p> element.

```css
div p {
  color: blue;
}

div > p {
  color: red;
}
```

In this case, `div > p` is more specific because it explicitly targets `<p>` elements that are direct children of `<div>`.  The first rule `div p` targets all `<p>` elements within a `<div>`, including those nested deeper than direct children.

This can lead to unexpected results, especially when dealing with nested elements and complex stylesheets where the order of selectors might not reflect the intended precedence.
