Several approaches resolve this issue:

**1. Increase Specificity of the First Selector:** Make the first selector more specific to match the target elements precisely:

```css
div p {
  color: blue;
}

div > p {
  color: red;
}
```

**2. Use `!important` (Less Recommended):** While functional, it is generally advised to avoid the `!important` flag for better maintainability and predictability.

```css
div p {
  color: blue !important;
}

div > p {
  color: red;
}
```

**3. Reorder CSS Rules (If Possible):** If the order doesn't impact other styles, placing the more specific rule *before* the less specific rule can resolve the issue, though this approach might not always be feasible.

```css
div > p {
  color: red;
}
div p {
  color: blue;
}
```

The preferred solution is to increase specificity or refactor the selectors appropriately for clarity and maintainability.
